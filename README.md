# OMSI XML2CFG TRANSPILER

### A simple XML format allowing for easier development of more complex buses in OMSI 2

*This format is Open Source and welcomes public contributions, feel free to open a PR!*

We are still in very early stages of the project, at the moment an XSD has been started, but many points are still missing in it. We do aim to create a transpiler in the near future to convert to and from the XML format.
